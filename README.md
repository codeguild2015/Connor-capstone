# Connor-capstone

Welcome to my capstone project. The goal of this project is to link bars to their respective twitter accounts, and then parse and display attributes of the bars based on their recent tweets. For example, it will show you which bars near a given address have live music, or no cover charge on a given night.

TO-DO
display recent tweets of a given bar when its marker is clicked.
improve fuzzy matching for twitter accounts, as well as tweet attributs
implement yelp data to provide more information
